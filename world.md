Trade Flow Analysis: Analyzed the trade data information for US IG & HY corporate bonds desks and helped them better manage clients request and inventory.
So this is like a data analysis or data mining project. As one of the biggest broker-dealer in fixed income market, Citi does a lot of trades with our clients, like mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds, etc. So we want to know if we can get any information from the trades we are doing with our clients. We want to answer questions like, if our clients are more informed player in the market, ie if they are buying the cheap bonds and selling the rich bonds, and if they have more expertise in one specific sector or specific time period. Or, from the bond's perspective, which bonds are more popular in the market and if the buy/sell activities at Citi would impact their prices in the coming days. 


Weekly Report: Published credit spread markets weekly reports on Citi Velocity to track market trends and model performance, and provide clients with insights of the market

Of course, it makes the taxi services so convenient to normal people. And the idea is so innovative in the sense that, everyone could be the driver, as well as the passenger. They share the thing they have with others, so people could get a car anywhere, anytime in a matter of minutes. This sharing greatly improve people's daily lives. I think Uber is a leader in this new way of business and has gained great success here. 

As a customer, I think the fact that Uber can't make reservation actually makes me feel not so convenient. But I believe there is a reason that Uber doesn't do that. Yet, I still think we can make some comprise between those two.
