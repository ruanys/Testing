# Hello world ruanys

tell me about yourself, what are you doing at Citi
I have been working at Citi as a quantitative analyst for almost two years and rotated between two desks.
In my current desk, i utilize quantitative models to help credit trading desks to better manage clients request and inventory. I also develop quantitative strategies in corporate bonds and CDS. 

In my previous desk, I focused on options volatility surface fitting, the algorithm improvement, bug fixes and system monitoring to support the equity derivatives trading desks. I also worked on some modeling on equity derivatives like the collateral discount model and Monte Carlo parser script. 

Before joining Citi, I got a master’s degrees in financial engineering and a bachelor’s degree in finance.  In my spared time, I am also taking online courses about machine learning and data analysis to get myself more exposure to that area and better prepared for the future career. 


2.  why do you leave Citi?
I think the opportunity offered at Goldman is more exciting. I get the chance to do solid research that can be applied to money management and see how the professional investment decisions are made while at the same time I can leverage my quantitative skills in the research and decision making. 



3. the projects you have done


Trade Flow Analysis: Analyzed the trade data information for US IG & HY corporate bonds desks and helped them better manage clients request and inventory.
So this is like a data analysis. 
So far, we are answering the following questions: 
which clients are the best performer, i.e. who always sell the rich bonds and buy the cheap bonds
which clients can predict the market trends? i.e
which bonds are most popular among clients and analyze the characteristics of those bonds
Also, use our existing relative value model to see if they are selling the rich bonds and buying the cheap bonds. 



Trading Strategy: Developed and implemented the desk’s corporate bond credit momentum strategy and CDS trading strategy. Both beat the index. 
the basic idea for CDS strategy being, first cut out the CDS that have the highest probability of default and then overweight the CDS that are cheap wrt its PD and underweight the cheap ones while at the same time rebalance between sector and ratings. we had a similar strategy before in corporate bonds. And I modified the strategy to apply it into the CDS index. 
momentum strategy: run the PD against the differences of dates between today and a previous day, if we see the deteriorating credit, then we will underweight that bonds


Model Implementation and Database Infrastructure: Re-implemented the desk’s core models for better efficiency, flexibility and robustness, and reduced the running time from several days to a few hours; Migrated the old database infrastructure to the new one

HPD: borrowing capacity & the firms debt/equity levels in the Merton model 
the firm’s profitability ratio, book value of leverage, and treated long-term and short-term debt differently
and fit a logistic function to calculate the firm’s probability of default 


4. your strength & weaknesses
I am a quick learner. I can always adapt to the new environment and learn new things very quickly. I am also a detail-oriented person to get things done. 
And.. I think the thing I like myself most is, I am a hard-working person and I will never give up my goal. I will always make progress in my life. 

persistent efforts
